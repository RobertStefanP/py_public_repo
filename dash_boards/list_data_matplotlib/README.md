# Plotting from Lists using Matplotlib

This folder contains simple practice plots created using data stored in Python 
lists and dictionaries. All visualizations are built using the **Matplotlib** library.

## Technologies
- Python 3
- Matplotlib

## Strategy
- Data is manually stored in lists or dictionaries inside the script.
- Each plot retrieves and organizes the data directly.
- The goal is to understand the basics of bar charts, pie charts, and other 
plot types without using external files.

## Plot Types
- Bar plots comparing values in different categories.
- Pie charts showing percentages of categories.
- Horizontal bar charts for layout variation.

## Purpose
These scripts are intended to help practice plotting with basic Python data structures.
